abstract = {The explosion of mobile applications both in number and variety raises the need of shedding light on their architecture, composition and quality. Indeed, it is crucial to understand which mobile application paradigm fits better to what type of application and usage. Such understanding has direct consequences on the user experience, the development cost and sale revenues of mobile apps. In this paper, we identified four main mobile application paradigms and evaluated them from the developer, user and service provider viewpoints. To ensure objectivity and soundness we start by defining high level criteria and then breaking down in finer-grained criteria. After a theoretical evaluation an implementation was carried out as a practical verification. The selected application is object recognition app, which is both exciting and challenging to develop.},

  abstract= {Machine learning is a popular method of learning functions from data to represent and to classify sensor inputs, multimedia, emails, and calendar events. Smartphone applications have been integrating more and more intelligence in the form of machine learning. Machine learning functionality now appears on most smartphones as voice recognition, spell checking, word disambiguation, face recognition, translation, spatial reasoning, and even natural language summarization. Excited app developers who want to use machine learning on mobile devices face one serious constraint that they did not face on desktop computers or cloud virtual machines: the end-user’s mobile device has limited battery life, thus computationally intensive tasks can harm end users’ phone availability by draining batteries of their stored energy. Currently, there are few guidelines for developers who want to employ machine learning on mobile devices yet are concerned about software energy consumption of their applications. In this paper, we combine empirical measurements of different machine learning algorithm implementations with complexity theory to provide concrete and theoretically grounded recommendations to developers who want to employ machine learning on smartphones. We conclude that some implementations of algorithms, such as J48, MLP, and SMO, do generally perform better than others in terms of energy consumption and accuracy, and that energy consumption is well-correlated to algorithmic complexity. However, to achieve optimal results a developer must consider their specific application as many factors — dataset size, number of data attributes, whether the model will require updating, etc. — affect which machine learning algorithm and implementation will provide the best results.}

  abstract ={From its origins with the advent of Apple’s iPhone in 2007, to an industry that could
potentially be worth as much as \$100 billion by 2015, the mobile apps industry has experienced
nearly unprecedented growth. The unique aspects of the industry are discussed in terms of how
they have encouraged the widespread popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices and
have transformed electronic gaming, internet retailing, and social networking. As major
competitors in this arena, Apple and Google have endeavored to distinguish themselves in terms
of their relationships with app developers, numbers and uniqueness of apps available, as well as
the marketplaces in which the apps are sold. While these battles are waged, others (Blackberry
RIM, Facebook, and Amazon) have continued to find their loyal users and niches in the market.
Forecasts unanimously paint a very bright future for the industry, but potential stumbling blocks
remain in the form of, monetization difficulties, accusations of exploiting children, and security
and privacy issues. }

  abstract={In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view.}

  abstract = {Software organizations are nowadays facing increased demand for modernizing their legacy software
systems using up-to-date technologies. The combination of Model-Driven Development and delivery
models like Cloud and Software as a Service have become a very promising approach for software
modernization that possesses a lot of advantages, including great deal of automation and reuse of system
functionality. However, the use of such new and immature technologies is very challenging and requires a
comprehensive methodology for their seamless application within the software modernization projects.
When developing such methodology, questions on whether agile methods and techniques should be
incorporated and what could be the benefits and implications from that become of particular interest. To
help answering these questions, the paper evaluates the potential of agile methods and techniques to address
the challenges of Model-Driven Modernization. The challenges are extracted through a systematic review of
the existing body of literature on Model-Driven Development and Software Modernization, and the
evaluation is conducted through the Delphi technique. As a result, a ranked list of applicable agile
techniques is proposed and suggestions for their use in Model-Driven Modernization are made.}

It includes traits, aspects, and mixins for separation of concerns. It supports embedding methods written in many object-oriented languages, enabling it to generate complete multilingual systems. It provides comprehensive analysis of models and generates many kinds of diagrams, some of which can be edited to update the Umple code. Umple runs on the command line, in a web browser or in integrated development environments. It is designed to help developers reduce code volume, while they develop in an agile, model-driven manner. Umple is also targeted at educational users where students are motivated by its ability to generate real systems from their software models.}
