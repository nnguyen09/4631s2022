abstract = {The explosion of mobile applications both in number and variety raises the need of shedding light on their architecture, composition and quality. Indeed, it is crucial to understand which mobile application paradigm fits better to what type of application and usage. Such understanding has direct consequences on the user experience, the development cost and sale revenues of mobile apps. In this paper, we identified four main mobile application paradigms and evaluated them from the developer, user and service provider viewpoints. To ensure objectivity and soundness we start by defining high level criteria and then breaking down in finer-grained criteria. After a theoretical evaluation an implementation was carried out as a practical verification. The selected application is object recognition app, which is both exciting and challenging to develop.},

  abstract= {Machine learning is a popular method of learning functions from data to represent and to classify sensor inputs, multimedia, emails, and calendar events. Smartphone applications have been integrating more and more intelligence in the form of machine learning. Machine learning functionality now appears on most smartphones as voice recognition, spell checking, word disambiguation, face recognition, translation, spatial reasoning, and even natural language summarization. Excited app developers who want to use machine learning on mobile devices face one serious constraint that they did not face on desktop computers or cloud virtual machines: the end-user’s mobile device has limited battery life, thus computationally intensive tasks can harm end users’ phone availability by draining batteries of their stored energy. Currently, there are few guidelines for developers who want to employ machine learning on mobile devices yet are concerned about software energy consumption of their applications. In this paper, we combine empirical measurements of different machine learning algorithm implementations with complexity theory to provide concrete and theoretically grounded recommendations to developers who want to employ machine learning on smartphones. We conclude that some implementations of algorithms, such as J48, MLP, and SMO, do generally perform better than others in terms of energy consumption and accuracy, and that energy consumption is well-correlated to algorithmic complexity. However, to achieve optimal results a developer must consider their specific application as many factors — dataset size, number of data attributes, whether the model will require updating, etc. — affect which machine learning algorithm and implementation will provide the best results.}

  abstract ={From its origins with the advent of Apple’s iPhone in 2007, to an industry that could
potentially be worth as much as \$100 billion by 2015, the mobile apps industry has experienced
nearly unprecedented growth. The unique aspects of the industry are discussed in terms of how
they have encouraged the widespread popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices and
have transformed electronic gaming, internet retailing, and social networking. As major
competitors in this arena, Apple and Google have endeavored to distinguish themselves in terms
of their relationships with app developers, numbers and uniqueness of apps available, as well as
the marketplaces in which the apps are sold. While these battles are waged, others (Blackberry
RIM, Facebook, and Amazon) have continued to find their loyal users and niches in the market.
Forecasts unanimously paint a very bright future for the industry, but potential stumbling blocks
remain in the form of, monetization difficulties, accusations of exploiting children, and security
and privacy issues. }

  abstract={In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view.}

  abstract = {Software organizations are nowadays facing increased demand for modernizing their legacy software
systems using up-to-date technologies. The combination of Model-Driven Development and delivery
models like Cloud and Software as a Service have become a very promising approach for software
modernization that possesses a lot of advantages, including great deal of automation and reuse of system
functionality. However, the use of such new and immature technologies is very challenging and requires a
comprehensive methodology for their seamless application within the software modernization projects.
When developing such methodology, questions on whether agile methods and techniques should be
incorporated and what could be the benefits and implications from that become of particular interest. To
help answering these questions, the paper evaluates the potential of agile methods and techniques to address
the challenges of Model-Driven Modernization. The challenges are extracted through a systematic review of
the existing body of literature on Model-Driven Development and Software Modernization, and the
evaluation is conducted through the Delphi technique. As a result, a ranked list of applicable agile
techniques is proposed and suggestions for their use in Model-Driven Modernization are made.}

  abstract = {The mobile application (app) industry has grown tremendously over the past ten years, primarily fueled by small app development businesses. Lacking advertising budgets, these small and relatively unknown businesses often offer free versions of their paid apps to be noticed in the crowded app industry and to reduce customer uncertainty about app quality and fit. The authors build on the existing marketing and information systems literature on sampling and versioning to investigate the implications of offering free versions for the adoption speed of paid apps. Using a unique data set of 7.7 million observations from 12,315 paid apps, and accounting for endogeneity, the authors find that although the practice of offering free versions of paid apps is popular, it is negatively associated with paid app adoption speed. They also find that this negative association between free version presence and paid app adoption speed is stronger both for hedonic apps and in the later life stages of paid apps. The authors hope that the study's results will encourage app developers to reevaluate their current strategy of offering free versions of paid apps and prompt academics to produce more work focusing on this industry.}

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.}

Despite progress in research on cross-platform techniques, results (i.e. apps) are not always satisfactory. They are subject to tedious tailoring and the development effort tends to be notable. In these cases, either pure web apps (realized through web browsers) or native apps (realized for each platform separately) are chosen. Recent activities have led to new approaches. In this paper, we have a closer look at three of these, namely React Native, the Ionic Framework, and Fuse. We present a comprehensive analysis of the three approaches. Our work is based on a real-world use case, which allows us to provide generalizable advice. Our findings suggest that there is no clear winner; the frameworks incorporate notable ideas and general progress in the field can be asserted.}

social media integration, and online shopping, all of which are platforms that enable the strengthening
of communication and foster interaction between firms and consumers. The related pieces of literature
on the continuous use of mobile apps have noted that apps must have convenience, unique value, social
value, incentives, entertainment, and other such qualities to attract continuous usage by customers. As
such, stickiness has become the key factor in the business success of apps. For businesses managing
mobile apps, the topics of how to design content for mobile device users, how to measure media value
and returns, and how to capture the attention of users and make them willing to spend more time using
the application are all worthy of exploration. This study proposes the analytical model for mobile app
stickiness to measure the significance of various influencing factors of the hierarchical structure and to
measure the performance of mobile apps. The study explored key factors that affected user stickiness
while examining usage statistics to develop management strategies geared toward mobile app sticki-
ness to improve customer/user loyalty. The proposed model can function as a tool for app planners in
measuring user stickiness and app performance while serving as reference for future studies into app
stickiness and real-life applications. It can also clarify the influence of key factors influencing app stick-
iness, which can help app planners develop appropriate strategies and function as a reference point for
future improvement and optimization strategies}

alternative to native development. Cross-platform tools aim
at sharing a significant portion of the application codebase

This can drastically decrease the development costs of mobile applications. There is, however, some reluctance of mobile application developers to adopt these tools. One of the
reasons is that the landscape of CPTs is so diverse that it is
hard to select the most suitable CPT to implement a specific
application. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First,
it presents a performance analysis of a fully functional mobile application implemented with ten cross-platform tools
and native for Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The performance tests are executed on a high- and low-end Android

based on the performance analysis, general conclusions of

developers lack guidance as to how to improve the energy

most useful. In this paper we conducted a small-scale empirical evaluation of commonly suggested energy-saving and
performance-enhancing coding practices. In the evaluation
we evaluated the degree to which these practices were able
to save energy as compared to their unoptimized code counterparts. Our results provide useful guidance for mobile app
developers. In particular, we found that bundling network
packets up to a certain size and using certain coding practices for reading array length information, accessing class
fields, and performing invocations all led to reduced energy
consumption. However, other practices, such as limiting
memory usage had a very minimal impact on energy usage. These results serve to inform the developer community
about specific coding practices that can help lower the overall energy consumption and improve the usability of their
applications. }

Objective: The aim with this paper is to provide an extensive review of existing mobile app development
models.
Method: The review is done by following a systematic literature review process. Also presented is an assessment of the usefulness and relevance to industry of the models based on a rigor and relevance framework.
Results: 20 primary studies were identified, each with distinct models. Agile methods or state-based principles
are commonly adopted across the models. Relatively little effort focuses on deployment, maintenance, project
evaluation activities.
Conclusion: The review reveals that the contexts in which the identified models are intended to be used vary.
This benefits practitioners as they are able to select a model that suits their contexts. However, the usefulness in
industry of most of the models, based on the contexts in which the models were evaluated, is questionable. There
is a need for evaluating mobile app models in contexts that resemble realistic contexts. The review also calls for
further research addressing special constraints of mobile apps, e.g., testing apps on multiple-platforms, user
involvement in release planning and continuous deployment.}
