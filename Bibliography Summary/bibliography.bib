abstract = {The explosion of mobile applications both in number and variety raises the need of shedding light on their architecture, composition and quality. Indeed, it is crucial to understand which mobile application paradigm fits better to what type of application and usage. Such understanding has direct consequences on the user experience, the development cost and sale revenues of mobile apps. In this paper, we identified four main mobile application paradigms and evaluated them from the developer, user and service provider viewpoints. To ensure objectivity and soundness we start by defining high level criteria and then breaking down in finer-grained criteria. After a theoretical evaluation an implementation was carried out as a practical verification. The selected application is object recognition app, which is both exciting and challenging to develop.},

  abstract= {Machine learning is a popular method of learning functions from data to represent and to classify sensor inputs, multimedia, emails, and calendar events. Smartphone applications have been integrating more and more intelligence in the form of machine learning. Machine learning functionality now appears on most smartphones as voice recognition, spell checking, word disambiguation, face recognition, translation, spatial reasoning, and even natural language summarization. Excited app developers who want to use machine learning on mobile devices face one serious constraint that they did not face on desktop computers or cloud virtual machines: the end-user’s mobile device has limited battery life, thus computationally intensive tasks can harm end users’ phone availability by draining batteries of their stored energy. Currently, there are few guidelines for developers who want to employ machine learning on mobile devices yet are concerned about software energy consumption of their applications. In this paper, we combine empirical measurements of different machine learning algorithm implementations with complexity theory to provide concrete and theoretically grounded recommendations to developers who want to employ machine learning on smartphones. We conclude that some implementations of algorithms, such as J48, MLP, and SMO, do generally perform better than others in terms of energy consumption and accuracy, and that energy consumption is well-correlated to algorithmic complexity. However, to achieve optimal results a developer must consider their specific application as many factors — dataset size, number of data attributes, whether the model will require updating, etc. — affect which machine learning algorithm and implementation will provide the best results.}

  abstract ={From its origins with the advent of Apple’s iPhone in 2007, to an industry that could
potentially be worth as much as \$100 billion by 2015, the mobile apps industry has experienced
nearly unprecedented growth. The unique aspects of the industry are discussed in terms of how
they have encouraged the widespread popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices and
have transformed electronic gaming, internet retailing, and social networking. As major
competitors in this arena, Apple and Google have endeavored to distinguish themselves in terms
of their relationships with app developers, numbers and uniqueness of apps available, as well as
the marketplaces in which the apps are sold. While these battles are waged, others (Blackberry
RIM, Facebook, and Amazon) have continued to find their loyal users and niches in the market.
Forecasts unanimously paint a very bright future for the industry, but potential stumbling blocks
remain in the form of, monetization difficulties, accusations of exploiting children, and security
and privacy issues. }
